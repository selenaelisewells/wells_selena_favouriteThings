# My Favourite Things - Horror Movies, Cats and Coffee <3
This is a simple mobile first web app that showcases three of my favourite things. 

## Description
To create this app, I used a combination of HTML, CSS3, JS, PHP and AJAX to grab data from a database and populate it on my page. I also implemented a lightbox using JS to populate more of that data onto the page.

##Installation
1. Import the database
2. View using WAMP/MAMP/LAMP to view the page
